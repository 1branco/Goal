# Goal
Goal is a Football Android app where you can check the results, standings, scorers and matches of your team or of your favorite football competition.
The data it's supplied by an free API from https://www.football-data.org/.
Check out the screenshot inside the project.

Work in progress...

## TO DO
 - [ ] - For the competitions that the API doesn't retrieve any standings, have to show the teams that are in that competition (possibly in another tab).
