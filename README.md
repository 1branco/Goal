Goal is a Football Android app where you can check the results, standings, scorers and matches of your team or of your favorite football competition.
The data it's supplied by an free API from https://www.football-data.org/, so don't be surprised if some information it's missing or something.
Check out the screenshots inside the project.

Work in progress...
